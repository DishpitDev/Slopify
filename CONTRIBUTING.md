## Git hash

> Why so stringent on the git hash?

Many open source repositories are subject to spam and fake pull requests. As such, any further pull requests should be closed if the git commit hash does not begin with three zeroes.

This is partially inspired by Tsoding's Twitter post:

> "Starting from today I will be requiring everybody to perform Bitcoin-Style Hashcash Proof-of-Work on all the submitted Pull Requests to reduce the amount of Spam. Please make sure all your Git Hashes have at least 2 leading zeros. Thank you for understanding!" (Tsoding, 2024)

This has been soon followed up by

> "Ok, since the probability of 2 zeros is still too high the policy has been updated to require at least 3. Thank you for your patience!" (Tsoding, 2024)
