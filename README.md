## Building and Running The Slopify App

Need to have Rust (cargo) installed.

`cd ./Slopify/Slopify`

`npm run tauri build`

`cd src-tauri/target/release`

`./slopify`

Please note that the Slopify App is a completely different experience from the Slopify Website.

The Website is a creative playground for shipping slop.

The app is a dedicated chat app for talking about shipping slop (or whatever tf else you wanna talk about).
